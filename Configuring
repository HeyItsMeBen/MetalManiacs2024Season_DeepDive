Configuring the robot:

Steps:
 
  1) Turn on the Driver Station. It should resemble a black cube with a screen.

  2) Ensure that the station is connected to the same Wifi as the control hub. I forgot what the name was, but I believe the password is metalmaniacs or something like that. 
     Otherwise, it could be just "password" and we forgot to change it which we should've done. Just hold it close to the control hub or something and pray it connects. 

  3) In the top right corner, press the three vertical dots. WHen a menu opens up, press "Configure Robot". Thsi should cause the robot to flash in multiple colors. 
  
  4) Press the section with the corresponding robot name (Such as if you wanted to modify the pushbot, you would press "pushbot").
 
  5) There will be multiple sections for different kinds of devices, such as motors or servos. Select the one that corresponds with the device you are trying to map.
 
  6) Find the corresponding port that the wire is connected to. In the dropbox, select the type of device it is (such as for a servo, a CRservo). Once done, name it based on the name 
     it has been given in the file. This is crucial as the mapping is the "bridge" between software and hardware. 
          - Note that the name will be case-sensitive

  7) Once finished, exit out and make sure to save. 
          - If you have nothing to change, such as just there to double check the name, DO NOT save
